### Welcome to my profile!

I'm Javier (Delunado), a Computer Engineer and Game Developer. I've always been passionate about programming and video games, so... **I program videogames!**
I'm also a devotee of refactoring, code architecture and, in general, **good programming practices**.

I'm also the organizer and moderator of the [Spain Game Devs community](https://twitter.com/spaingamedevs), a huge community of spanish developers. I have also solo organized the [Spain Game Devs Jam II](https://itch.io/jam/spain-game-devs-jam-ii), one of the biggest (if not the biggest) Spanish Game Jams, with more than 560 participants, 130 games submitted, 6000€ in prizes, etc.   

## Experience and Projects.
These are some of my finished projects and past experiences. 

### Games

- [Clownbiosis](https://delunado.itch.io/clownbiosis): In Clownbiosis you play as a little clownfish who lives in an anemone. You have to recolect food in order to feed you and your anemone. But be careful! If you don't feed it, the anemone will die. Our main objective with the game was to provide a beautiful and relaxed experience. Forget about the problems and enjoy with the incredible music and wonderful art. I worked as a solo programmer and designer, within a team of 3.

- [Nino, your grandpa is nuts!](https://eufrasi0.itch.io/nino): Nino, your grandpa is nuts! is a *Turn-Based Twin-Stick Shooter* where you play as Nino. You have to go find your grandpa, who has gone nuts for reading too much books. I worked as a solo programmer, and also on game design and narrative, within a team of 3. The game is made in just 7 days!

- [Keeping IT alive](https://github.com/Delunado/Keeping-IT-Alive-LudumDare46): Keeping IT alive is a *creepy procedural scroller* where you play as Jose María, a common guy. He is alone, walking on a rainy day. Then, a surprise in the sewers changes his life for the next 7 days. Using Unity. I was the main programmer and game designer, within a team of 3.

- [Three Once](https://github.com/Delunado/ThreeOnce-JamGame): Three Once is a *puzzled platformer* where you play as a broken robot. This scrappy robot has to reach the door on each level, and for this purpose he can do three things, besides moving: jumping, shooting and dashing. But, as he is broken, he can only do each one only once! Using Unity. I did everything on this Jam: design, code, art and music.

- [Godsus](https://github.com/Delunado/Godsus): Godsus is a *local-multiplayer fighting* game, where the players play as the spirit of two ancients God, Soleo and Lunea, who have faced each other for millennia. Each player can posses the powerful little creatures that populate the world, and use their powers against its enemy. Each creature is unique and have its own combination of powers! I was the main programmer and game designer, within a team of 4.

- [Crybots](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.TEA.TwoEngineersAlone.CryBots): Crybots is an *arcade game, easy to play but hard to master*. The CryBots are faulty robots that can feel emotions, so they are discarded and destroyed. They need you to give them a hand (or rather a finger) to survive! CryBots is a free mobile game, playable on Android. It was my second launched game, where I worked as a programmer and game designer.

- [Borro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.TEA.TwoEngineersAlone.Borro): Borro is a *Pang inspired side-scroller*, where you play as Borro, a little being who has lost his beloved stone. Borro is a free mobile game, playable on Android. It was my first complete game at all, launched around 2018, and I'm very proud of the result. I worked as a programmer, game designer and narrative writer.

### Demos
These are demos of interesting mechanics and concepts I've programmed.

- [Tribalia](https://delunado.itch.io/tribalia): Tribalia is a life simulation. The little Thumboys live in the wild nature, exploring the world, eating and fighting their brothers. And you can watch it! Now in Version 0.1.

- [Finders!](https://github.com/Delunado/Finders): Finders! is a simulation using genetic algorithms, where the little Finders have to find a way to the exit through generations. You can build your own map to challenge the Finders!

- [ALIFE](https://github.com/Delunado/ALIFE/): ALIFE is an Artificial Intelligence and Genetic Algorithms simulation, where a bunch of little creatures try to survive and breed.

- [Star Wars - Force Demo](https://github.com/Delunado/Star-Wars-Force-Demo): A demo of some "Star Wars"-like powers. You can use telekinesis to move and push objects! Using Unity.

- [MinecraftIGV](https://github.com/Delunado/MinecraftIGV): A Minecraft-inspired project using C++ & OpenGL. You can move around, create and destroy blocks... It was a very interesting degree task!


### Applications
These are some finished applications I've programmed.

- [Game Of Life - ASCII](https://github.com/Delunado/GameOfLifeAscii): A Game Of Life version using ASCII characters and the console. Using C#.

- [Random Screenshots from Prnt.sc](https://github.com/Delunado/RandomScreenshotPrnt): A program which shows random screenshots hosted on Prnt.sc, taking advantage of a web's vulnerability.


### Bots
These are some curious and useful bots.

- [This Person Does Not Exist Bot](https://github.com/Delunado/ThisPersonDoesNotExistBot): A Twitter bot which uploads images from https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/. Using C#.

- [Game Dev Resources Bot](https://github.com/Delunado/GameDevResourcesBot): A Telegram bot which manages content sent to a Game Dev Resources channel. Using C#.


## Learning about...
These are some things I'm learning about right now!

### Polaris Engine
After 2+ years of learning Unity and C# (as well as other languages and technologies, like C++, Python, Godot, etc.) I decided to develop my own Game Engine, for the sake of learning.

So here borns **Polaris Engine**! It's a game engine developed in C++ & OpenGL. It contains three principal modules:
- Urano, the Math module.
- Thea, the Rendering module.
- Gea, the Physics module.

It's a work in progress, constantly evolving. You can take a look to the Engine repo [here](https://github.com/Delunado/PolarisEngine)! 

### Better C++
C++ is one of the most important programming languages, and this is also a reality in game development. So, after using it for more than 2 years in collegue, I'm reviewing and deeply studying it again.

For this task I'm mainly using the book ["C++ Primer - 5th Edition"](https://www.amazon.es/C-Primer-Stanley-B-Lippman/dp/0321714113). As I complete the book recommended exercices, I upload them to [this repository](https://github.com/Delunado/CPP-Primer-Exercices).

Also, I daily use [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/delunado) and [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/Delunado), websites where I can practice my C++ and  my problem solving skills through challenging exercices. At the same time, I'm sharpening my skills for competitive programming (one of my hobbies!).


### VR
I'm learning a bit about the fascinating world of Virtual Reality development, using Unity, C# and an Oculus Rift S.
