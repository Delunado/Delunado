### Welcome to my GitHub profile! (Work In Progress)

I'm Javier (Delunado), a Computer Engineer and Game Developer. I've always been passionate about programming and video games, so... **I program videogames!**
I'm also a devotee of refactoring, code architecture and, in general, **good programming practices**.

## Experience and Projects.

### Demos
These are demos of interesting mechanics and concepts I've programmed.

- [Star Wars - Force Demo](https://github.com/Delunado/Star-Wars-Force-Demo): A demo of some "Star Wars"-like powers. You can use telekinesis to move and push objects! Using Unity.

- [MinecraftIGV](https://github.com/Delunado/MinecraftIGV): A Minecraft-inspired project using C++ & OpenGL. You can move around, create and destroy blocks... It was a very interesting degree task!  

### Jam Games
These are games from Game Jams I've participated, alone or in a team.

- [Three Once](https://github.com/Delunado/ThreeOnce-JamGame): Three Once is a *puzzled platformer* where you play as a broken robot. This scrappy robot has to reach the door on each level, and for this purpose he can do three things, besides moving: jumping, shooting and dashing. But, as he is broken, he can only do each one only once! Using Unity.

- [Keeping IT alive](https://github.com/Delunado/Keeping-IT-Alive-LudumDare46): Keeping IT alive is a *creepy procedural scroller* where you play as Jose Mar√≠a, a common guy. He is alone, walking on a rainy day. Then, a surprise in the sewers changes his life for the next 7 days. Using Unity.

### Applications
These are some finished applications I've programmed.

- [Game Of Life - ASCII](https://github.com/Delunado/GameOfLifeAscii): A Game Of Life version using ASCII characters and the console. Using C#.

### Bots
These are some curious and useful bots.

- [This Person Does Not Exist Bot](https://github.com/Delunado/ThisPersonDoesNotExistBot): A Twitter bot which uploads images from https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/. Using C#.

- [Game Dev Resources Bot](https://github.com/Delunado/GameDevResourcesBot): A Telegram bot which manages content sent to a Game Dev Resources channel. Using C#.
