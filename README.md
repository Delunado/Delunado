# Hi, I'm Javier (Delunado)! üëã

I'm a Software Engineer and Game Developer. I've always been passionate about programming and videogames, so... **I program videogames!**
I'm also a devotee of refactoring, code architecture, clean code and, in general, **good programming practices**.

I'm the admin of the [Spain Game Devs community](https://twitter.com/spaingamedevs) üá™üá∏, a huge community of hispanic developers. I have solo organized the [Spain Game Devs Jam II](https://itch.io/jam/spain-game-devs-jam-ii), the biggest spanish Game Jam ever made, with more than 560 participants, 130 games submitted, 6000‚Ç¨ in prizes, 25 sponsors, etc. This Jam won the DeVuego prize to Best 2020 Game Jam! ‚úåÔ∏è

## Currently working on... üß≠

### Polaris Engine ‚ú¥Ô∏è
After 3+ years of learning and using Unity/C# I decided to develop my own Game Engine, for the sake of learning.

So here borns **Polaris Engine**! It is an early-stage 2D/3D Game Engine created from scratch, using C++ & OpenGL.
The game engine contains several modules and submodules, as well as a visual editor.

It's a work in progress, long term project, constantly evolving. You can take a look to the Engine repo [here](https://github.com/Delunado/PolarisEngine)!

## Learning about... üìö
These are some things I'm learning about right now!

### Better C++ ‚å®Ô∏è
C++ is one of the most important programming languages, and this is also a reality in game development. So, after using it for more than 2 years in collegue, I'm reviewing and deeply studying it again.

For this task I'm mainly using the book ["C++ Primer - 5th Edition"](https://www.amazon.es/C-Primer-Stanley-B-Lippman/dp/0321714113). As I complete the book recommended exercices, I upload them to [this repository](https://github.com/Delunado/CPP-Primer-Exercices).

Also, I daily use [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/delunado) and [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/Delunado), websites where I can practice my C++ and  my problem solving skills through challenging exercices. At the same time, I'm sharpening my skills for competitive programming (one of my hobbies!).

### VR üëì
I'm learning a bit about the fascinating world of Virtual Reality development, using Unity, C# and an Oculus Rift S.

Some of my experiments [here](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6692492604698849280/)!
