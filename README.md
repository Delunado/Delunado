### Welcome to my profile!

I'm Javier (Delunado), a Computer Engineer and Game Developer. I've always been passionate about programming and video games, so... **I program videogames!**
I'm also a devotee of refactoring, code architecture and, in general, **good programming practices**.

## Working on...

- News soon!!

## Learning about...
These are some things I'm learning about right now!

### Polaris Engine
After 2+ years of learning Unity and C# (as well as other languages and technologies, like C++, Python, Godot, etc.) I decided to develop my own Game Engine, for the sake of learning.

So here borns **Polaris Engine**! It's a game engine developed in C++ & OpenGL. It contains three principal modules:
- Urano, the Math module.
- Thea, the Rendering module.
- Gea, the Physics module.

It's a work in progress, constantly evolving. You can take a look to the Engine repo [here](https://github.com/Delunado/PolarisEngine)! 

### Better C++
C++ is one of the most important programming languages, and this is also a reality in game development. So, after using it for more than 2 years in collegue, I'm reviewing and deeply studying it again.

For this task I'm mainly using the book ["C++ Primer - 5th Edition"](https://www.amazon.es/C-Primer-Stanley-B-Lippman/dp/0321714113). As I complete the book recommended exercices, I upload them to [this repository](https://github.com/Delunado/CPP-Primer-Exercices).

Also, I daily use [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/delunado) and [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/Delunado), websites where I can practice my C++ and  my problem solving skills through challenging exercices. At the same time, I'm sharpening my skills for competitive programming (one of my hobbies!).


### VR
I'm learning a bit about the fascinating world of Virtual Reality development, using Unity, C# and an Oculus Rift S.

## Experience and Projects.
These are some of my finished projects and past experiences. 

### Demos
These are demos of interesting mechanics and concepts I've programmed.

- [Star Wars - Force Demo](https://github.com/Delunado/Star-Wars-Force-Demo): A demo of some "Star Wars"-like powers. You can use telekinesis to move and push objects! Using Unity.

- [MinecraftIGV](https://github.com/Delunado/MinecraftIGV): A Minecraft-inspired project using C++ & OpenGL. You can move around, create and destroy blocks... It was a very interesting degree task!  

### Game Jams
These are games from Game Jams I've participated, alone or in a team.

- [Three Once](https://github.com/Delunado/ThreeOnce-JamGame): Three Once is a *puzzled platformer* where you play as a broken robot. This scrappy robot has to reach the door on each level, and for this purpose he can do three things, besides moving: jumping, shooting and dashing. But, as he is broken, he can only do each one only once! Using Unity.

- [Keeping IT alive](https://github.com/Delunado/Keeping-IT-Alive-LudumDare46): Keeping IT alive is a *creepy procedural scroller* where you play as Jose Mar√≠a, a common guy. He is alone, walking on a rainy day. Then, a surprise in the sewers changes his life for the next 7 days. Using Unity.

### Applications
These are some finished applications I've programmed.

- [Game Of Life - ASCII](https://github.com/Delunado/GameOfLifeAscii): A Game Of Life version using ASCII characters and the console. Using C#.

- [Random Screenshots from Prnt.sc](https://github.com/Delunado/RandomScreenshotPrnt): A program which shows random screenshots hosted on Prnt.sc, taking advantage of a web's vulnerability.

### Bots
These are some curious and useful bots.

- [This Person Does Not Exist Bot](https://github.com/Delunado/ThisPersonDoesNotExistBot): A Twitter bot which uploads images from https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/. Using C#.

- [Game Dev Resources Bot](https://github.com/Delunado/GameDevResourcesBot): A Telegram bot which manages content sent to a Game Dev Resources channel. Using C#.
