## Learning about... üìö

### Rust ü¶Ä

After 5+ years of learning and working with Unity/C# + developing simple C++ projects like 3D rendereres, I decided to try out the shiny new language Rust. Right now, I'm:

- Solving Advent of Code problems ([repo here](https://github.com/Delunado/Advent-Of-Code-22-Rust.git)).
- Developing a small roguelike using Bevy, called RustySpace ([repo here](https://github.com/Delunado/Rustyspace)).
